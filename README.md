# LLMonPy

> *We started with glee, so deceived,  
> Assuming the task was easily achieved.  
> But the work, it got tough,  
> And the going got rough,  
> Yet we conquered, so proudly relieved!*    
  
     

##### LlmonPy is an open-source LLM pipeline framework where:
> 1. Every step has an evaluator to determine if the step was completed successfully. 
> 2. The input and output of each step is recorded so a step can be isolated and refined without running the whole pipeline
> 3. Python is used for orchestration
> 4. It is not ready to release yet.  But it will be soon! Follow this organization if you want updates.

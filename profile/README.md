# LlmonPy
*pronounced lemon pie*

LlmonPy is an open-source LLM pipeline framework where:
> 1. Every step has an evaluator to determine if the step was completed successfully. 
> 2. The input and output of each step is recorded so a step can be isolated and refined without running the whole pipeline
> 3. Python is used for orchestration
> 4. It is not ready to release yet.  But it will be soon! Follow this organization if want updates.
